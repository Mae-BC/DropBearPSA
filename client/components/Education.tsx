            </div>
            <p>
              The drop bear (Thylarctos plummetus) is a species of koala, but
              unlike their docile, herbivore relatives drop bears are known for
              their predatory and carnivorous tendancies. They are often much
              larger and known for attacking prey from trees which is where they
              draw their name from. They are associated with attacking tourists,
              which many link to the fact tourists will be more likely to
              explore australias remote regions on holidays which leads to them
              being targeted more frequently, as well as interacting with drop
              bears as they will wrongly assume it is a regular koala and
              approach it eager for a photo with one of australias iconic
              animals. Some locals have claimed the drop bear can detect accents
              and uses this to target tourists, but this is not scientifically
              proven.Although drop bears attack viciously there are no confirmed
              deaths of a drop bear attack.

              <h3>Origins of the drop-bear</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              Although the origins of the drop bear are cloudy, The first
              recorded encounter happened in 1967 in an article of the newspaper
              "Army", an australian military newspaper. This article included
              mention of a "Dreaded drop bear", with further articles by the
              same newspaper referancing "the legends and stories of drop bears
              that supposedly originated there". Many infer from these early
              mentions being army related that the drop-bear was a product of
              military testing on koalas, or simply harrasment by foreign
              soldiers in australia as at this time many foreign military bases
              were established. None of the rumours can be confirmed, but are
              often cited as the reason a drop-bear is physically different and
              much more aggressive.

              <h3>Feeding & Diet</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              Stories of kill sites and examination of scats suggest mainly
              medium to large species of mammal make a substantial proportion of
              the animal's diet. Often, prey such as macropods are larger than
              the Drop Bear itself. Drop Bears supposedly hunt by ambushing
              ground dwelling animals from above, waiting up to as much as four
              hours to make a surprise kill. Once prey is within view, the Drop
              Bear will drop as much as eight metres to pounce on top of the
              unsuspecting victim. The initial impact often stuns the prey,
              allowing it to be bitten on the neck and quickly subdued. If the
              prey is small enough Drop Bears will haul it back up the tree to
              feed without harassment from other predators.

            </div>
            <p>
              The attacks are normally encountered by bush walkers being
              'dropped on' by drop bears, resulting in injury including mainly
              lacerations and occasionally bites. Most attacks are considered
              accidental and there are no stories of incidents being fatal.
              There are some suggested folk remedies that are said to act as a
              repellent to Drop Bears, these include having forks in the hair or
              Vegemite or toothpaste spread behind the ears. There is no
              evidence to suggest that any such repellents work.
